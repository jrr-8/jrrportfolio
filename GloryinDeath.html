Third, when he watched the life leave Hektor&rsquo;s eyes through the slits in his helmet&mdash;the helmet that had once belonged to Achilles himself, loaned to Patroklos and then taken from his corpse as spoil&mdash;and felt the seal closing on his own mortal fate, through his own actions now made immanent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was prepared to accept it. Whether by sword or by spear, when the final wound pierced his flesh, he would welcome it with dignity. He imagined that Thanatos&rsquo; grip could not feel colder or emptier than he already did, walking the earth with half his soul departed to Hades ahead of the rest of him. He was ready to join it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up until the arrow struck. Face to face with his self-sown fate, Achilles fought it. It was not in his nature to succumb easily&mdash;not to the Trojan army, not to Agamemnon, and not to Death. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Like when lightning strikes down on a forest, the sting in his heel </span><span class="c2">hit</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;first in a flash: white-hot but gone in an instant. Then an orange glow builds among the trees, the fire small at first but spreading quickly, and within seconds Achilles whole leg felt as though he had already stepped into his own funeral pyre. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift-footed no longer, one knee buckling from the pain and the other trembling under his weight, Achilles summoned all his god-like strength as he fought to remain standing. He used his shield like an old man&rsquo;s cane to prop up his injured side: the finest craftsmanship of Hephaestus himself, unmarred by any spear but caked with the dust of the battlefield, the perfect sphere of it appearing blunted as one edge dug into the earth. It wobbled under his weight as the ground beneath him, previously solid and copper-colored, began mixing with the blood flowing from his heel and transmuting into a muddy, crimson marsh. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A spear might have been more effective in holding him up, but Achilles&rsquo; weapon had been flung from his grip only moments before the arrow struck him, pulled as if by an invisible sting&mdash;the first sign that the gods&rsquo; favor had abandoned him at last. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Vitality rapidly leaving his body with the river of wine-dark blood, Achilles at last fell prone, his shield faltering in the mud like the roots of a tree loosened from their soil by a flood, and his waning body was the trunk, top-heavy without its foundation, collapsing onto the dirt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first cry erupted from somewhere to the east, joined quickly by a rippling wave of shouts and wails as realization spread through the still-fighting Achaeans. But Achilles, his sense clouded by terrible pain and anticipation of the approaching end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Never in all his battles had Achilles felt a wound like this one. Was his sole point of vulnerability perhaps more susceptible to pain than the rest of his skin? Had the water of the Styx shielded him from pain as much as injury?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As he lay there, his lungs gasping and heaving for breath that he knew would not come, Achilles could not help but think to himself (and with an acid laugh caught in his throat): </span><span class="c2 c3">Paris? </span><span class="c2">I</span><span class="c1">t had to be Paris, of all people? No doubt he was aided by divine boon; only Apollo&rsquo;s guiding hand could have borne the shot that found the bulls-eye of Achilles&rsquo; only weak point, and from Paris&rsquo; bow, no less. Still, it stings his proud heart to think of the songs: the greatest warrior of all the Achaeans, felled by the least adept fighter out of all of Troy&rsquo;s princes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2 c3">Does it soothe your hurt, son of Peleus, to know that the songs of this moment have been lost to time? That ages have risen and fallen, and still we know your name? We read of your deeds and we know your pride, your rage, your grief. We know the manner of your death, but not what was in your heart just before it ceased beating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2 c3">What would you tell us of that moment, if you could speak your own tale? What would you say after the Muses went silent?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It took several long, brutal minutes, h</span><span class="c1">is senses fading further with every passing second, as unconscious death rolled over him like an early morning fog over the hills; a cloud overtaking his mind from thought and awareness until, eventually, neither the stinging in his heart nor the stinging in his heel remained. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Achilles did not see how his brothers in arms fought to retrieve his body like a pack of lions protecting a cub. He did not see Ajax lift him up, gentle and reverent even in the midst of chaotic battle, to carry him back to the ships. He did not see the pyre burning or feel the fire consuming him, nor did he hear his mother Thetis, her devastated wails piercing up to Mount Olympus. There is nothing comparable to the grief of a mother who outlives her son. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Instead, Achilles saw&mdash;or, not </span><span class="c2 c3">saw</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;exactly, a spirit now and without proper vision&mdash;but was aware via some new, limbic sense that informed him his guide had arrived. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before him, the winged-soled Hermes seemed huge and bright as a star, blotting out every other detail of their surroundings in a place somewhere in the overlap between memory and nothingness. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They did not walk or sail or fly, but rather traveled together in the manner of gods and dreams, towards the Underworld. Achilles was whisked off with the messenger of the gods, without intention to move but also absent a desire to stay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At some point during this durationless journey, Achilles found the will somewhere within him to speak, and he asked his shepherd, &ldquo;Are they pleased with me? Did I put on a good </span><span class="c2">showing</span><span class="c1">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The voices of the dead don&rsquo;t carry much in the way of tone; Hermes nevertheless forgave the subtle trace of bitterness laving Achilles&rsquo; question</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The god replied, &ldquo;It was certainly one of the greatest I have ever seen&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve seen a great many. You will make an excellent story.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">///</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Patroklos is there waiting to greet him when his soul crosses the Styx, and Achilles immediately rushes to embrace him. His last, greatest consolation: to be on the same plane of existence once again as his love.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the touch does not register as it should: there is no warmth, no familiar pressure, just as when he previously tried to embrace the specter of Patroklos that had visited him in his dream. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The dead cannot take comfort in the press of flesh when they have none. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Achilles braces himself for another crushing wave of grief to overtake him at this realization, as it had before, but the sobs do not come. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The ever-present sadness that has clung to Achilles since his first death has not left him in the Underworld, but it does feel dampened here, like a melody heard from the opposite side of a thick wall. Emotion has not left him in death, but he is disconnected from the experience of it just as he is from the sensations of his body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is both a relief and a profound discomfort. He feels as though he has spent his whole life running with weights on his ankles that he never knew were there. In life, he learned to bear the burden of corporeality because he had never known any other way of being. Now, freed from the shackles, he feels its absence most acutely. The weightlessness of death is disconcerting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You will get used to it faster than you expect.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Patroklos, as always </span><span class="c2">so adept</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;at reading Achilles that it seemed like he could reach into his head and see his thoughts as plain as day. The familiarity of it warms Achilles, but that comfort and reassurance quickly turn to ice as he continues to take in his companion&rsquo;s ghostly visage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You fool!&rdquo; If his hands could grip, he would twist Patroklos&rsquo; tunic in his fists and shake him&mdash;but his fists are made of water here and Patroklos is wearing fabric woven from shadows. &ldquo;You wretched fool, I told you. I </span><span class="c2">said rout</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the Trojans from our ships, but do not chase them down!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It was not for you to </span><span class="c2">fell</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Troy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The gods in their anger, they would never have permitted you to succeed!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anger roils in Achilles with the force of a storm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then </span><span class="c2 c3">why</span><span class="c1">?&rdquo; he roars, and as the cry leaves his throat, for the scantest moment he feels like his living self again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Patroklos does not answer. Instead, he asks calmly, &ldquo;You went after Hektor, didn&rsquo;t you? You rejoined the battle to avenge my slaughter. That is why you are here with me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course I did.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And who avenged Hektor&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Achilles pauses before answering, but he has never hidden his shames from Patroklos.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Paris.&rdquo; He adds, &ldquo;By way of Apollo.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Fury flashes over Patroklos like a lightning bolt illuminating an ash-black sky. It fades just as quickly, but to Achilles the air remains electrified.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I wish him a </span><span class="c2">brutal</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;death, as punishment for what he has taken from the world.&rdquo; Patroklos puts a ghostly hand to Achilles&rsquo; equally ghostly cheek, and he gives a soft, mildly sardonic smile. &ldquo;But that business is not for us any longer.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; says Achilles, a vortex of conflicting angers&mdash;at Hektor, at Patroklos, at the gods, at himself&mdash;still boiling in his heart. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You already know, Achilles. You know better than anyone what it is to be in the midst of battle. I pursued the Trojan army because in those moments, watching my&mdash;</span><span class="c2 c3">our</span><span class="c1">&mdash;brothers-in-arms killed all around me, my heart knew nothing but rage and bloodlust. I forgot reason, forgot humility, forgot even my promise to you. And I paid for my forgetfulness; this is the way of war.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We could have escaped.&rdquo; There is an aching plea in Achilles&rsquo; words, as if the Fates might be listening. As if they would ever heed it. &ldquo;We could have won the war and been away from that place. Lived as heroes&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Patroklos cocks his head, considering. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;if we were different people. But I wouldn&rsquo;t want us to have been. Do you </span><span class="c2">wish</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that? That you were not born to a great king and an immortal goddess, had not become the greatest of the Achaeans? That we might have lived a quiet, humble life together and died quiet, humble deaths?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Achilles shakes his head. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense: if I were not Peleus&rsquo; son, we would never have met.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And if we were not both the type of men to charge into battle after our friends, the type who feel the heat of battle in our very veins, then I don&rsquo;t imagine we would have had much to say to each other.&rdquo; Patroklos smiles. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly my point. It had to be this way; it could not have been any other. And I don&rsquo;t have room in my heart to be angry at my fate; not if that would mean resenting everything that came before it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is a dance they have done many times before: Achilles, overcome with passion; Patroklos, attempting to talk him down without ever contradicting. It is as Patroklos says&mdash;their souls are made of the same fiery substance. But Patroklos built a cage to contain his flame long ago, while Achilles burns through everything in his path. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I understand what you say, Patroklos. But I don&rsquo;t find logic as soothing to my rage as you seem to.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And I love you for that; your rage is beautiful as the sun to me. But Achilles, what I&rsquo;m trying to tell you is that you will have to find a way to put it aside eventually, because there is no vengeance to be had down here, and no glory to be gained either.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;If that is the case, what do we do?&rdquo; Achilles asks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We rest.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">///</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Death is boring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2 c3">Oh, son of Peleus, godlike Achilles, you strove all your life for greatness. Kleos was your purpose and your birthright, the truest and ultimate goal for the child of an immortal. It demanded your every effort, yet was also what you could not help but be: Great. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c2 c3">The success of a life is measured based on how it ends. You ended glorious.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alive, Achilles had rarely felt heroic in the moment of the act. Action consumed him, and it was only afterward, when they stacked laurels on his head and honor on name, that he reflected and nodded in agreement: yes, it had been heroic. Yes, he was great. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dead, Achilles does not feel heroic at all. He knows, both by reason and by some posthumous instinct, that word of his death had spread up above, and that bards were singing the glory of his name across the living world. But their praise and pride does not reach him here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A good death, a great death, should be satisfying, shouldn&rsquo;t it? A neat and fitting end, even if tragic. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At least after tragedy, there is rest. And Achilles has rest in spades here, the infinite stretch of time to fill with all the heavenly pleasures Elysium has to offer&mdash;but a dog that is bred and raised for the hunt never quite loses the drive, even when his eyes are cloudy and his muzzle is gray. Even when there is no more prey left, his legs still ache for the chase. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Achilles does not feel restful. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Feeling at all is different for a shade, he learns. Awareness takes a great deal of effort, be it internal or external, and there is less room in general for emotion; they come simply and one at a time, compared to the multitudinous cacophony of contradiction that was feeling alive. Yet despite this, Achilles finds he cannot quite adapt to the singularity of death. Some part of him still remembers the chaos of life and resents its absence. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Is it an absence or a presence? The absence of activity around him, the absence of restfulness inside him. Too many feelings clawing at the edges of his mind and no capacity to contain them all, they clog at the bottleneck and he ends up feeling nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not restful. Not proud. Not great. Just dead. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The monotony of the Underworld is broken periodically by the arrival of another brother-in-arms. Ajax, Agamemnon, Antilochus; one by one they filter down to join their fallen brethren. There is joy in these reunions, but of a subdued and sober kind. The dead all share the same thought, so obvious to them that it need not be spoken: They are here, and it is better to be here together than to be here apart, but it is far better to be there than here, even though it is unbearable to be there and apart.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s different when Odysseus arrives. They all recognize the magnetic pull of mortality still clinging to him; he is alive, and does not belong here. His presence is unnatural and makes them all feel unnaturally alive through proximity alone, an energy that is sweet and intoxicating and almost sickening, like especially strong wine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A crowd of spirits clambers to approach and speak to the interloper. If any mortal could figure out how to enter the land of the dead without dying, of course it would be Odysseus&mdash;but for what possible reason?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Achilles asks him as much, when he finally makes it to the front of the line, asks what could possibly motivate a man to go where only numb and tired spirits dwell.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Bad luck,&rdquo; Odysseus answers him wearily, and it must be true: he looks not only older now than when Achilles last saw him, but worn and weathered by more than mere time, eroded like a rock beaten down by unceasing tides. &ldquo;Not like you, Achilles, no one has ever been as lucky as you, or ever will. You are the greatest in death as you were in life: as respected as the gods and nigh as powerful. You have great power here among the dead, Achilles. You should not be bitter at your death.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lucky</span><span class="c2 c3">, </span><span class="c2">he calls him. </span><span class="c2">Great</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">and </span><span class="c2">powerful</span><span class="c2 c3">, </span><span class="c2">he says, </span><span class="c2">unto the gods</span><span class="c1">! The highest praise for a warrior. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">What do these words mean, what</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">can</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c2 c3">they mean, to a dead man? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Do not be bitter,&rsquo; he says.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7 c2 c3">What is bitterness to the dead? </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odysseus doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s talking about.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">&ldquo;I would rather be a poor slave among the living than rule as a king over the dead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Achilles were alive, he would not have left it at that. If he were still unchanged from his living self, either anger as Odysseus&rsquo; na&iuml;vet&eacute; or pride at his praise would burn in Achilles&rsquo; heart. In death, however, he feels a fraction of that passion, far too faint to distract him from his mission. With Odysseus&rsquo; miraculous appearance in the Underworld, Achilles has once again, for the first time since dying, a goal and a limited time to complete it, and these are far more energizing forces. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But forget this,&rdquo; he hurries on. &ldquo;Odysseus, do you bring any news of my son, or my father? How have they fared since I have been gone? Tell me everything, please.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead do not dream, but fear over the unknown fates of his family have plagued Achilles like waking nightmares since arriving in Hades.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Odysseus obeys his exhortation. Achilles can&rsquo;t help thinking that, if he were truly as lucky as Odysseus claimed he was, then he would be hearing good news regarding both his father and his son. Still, Achilles savors every word Odysseus offers him, and the stories he tells of Neoptolemus&rsquo; exploits through the end of the war fill his unbeating heart with warmth and pride.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His son is alive. He is alive and well and glorious. He made it out of Troy unblemished. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odysseus departs soon after this, having had his fill of conversations with dead people, the glow of life vanishing with him. The shades all retreat back to their </span><span class="c2">paradising</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;like moths abandoning a snuffed flame&mdash;except for Achilles, who lingers at the shore, gazing into the white rapids of the Styx.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">These same shadow-black waters had once engulfed him; this same violent current had buffeted his newborn body about while his mother held onto him by just one heel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Terrible danger </span><span class="c2">to subject an</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;infant to, almost certainly lethal had he been fully mortal and not half-god. A mother should balk at the mere idea of it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3 c7">Do not be bitter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He doesn&rsquo;t feel bitter. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Achilles was too young at the time to retain a memory of the experience; any recollection he might conjure is a fiction of his mind, put together from pieces after the fact. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Whether true or illusory, a memory surfaces now: of being clutched in Thetis&rsquo; white arms, borne towards the edge of the river, facing its depths. He does not fear the water. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A hand settles softly on Achilles&rsquo; shoulder, and he knows who it belongs to without needing to turn and look.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Patroklos was right, back when he said Achilles would get used to this. He&rsquo;s now attuned to the muted sensations of the afterlife, can register and identify the ever-so-faint shiver that corresponds to the touch of another shade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They stand together in silence for a time. Eventually, Achilles speaks, without moving his gaze from the water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you think Odysseus will make it back to Ithaca?&rdquo; he asks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answers Patroklos.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I hope he does.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;His son,&rdquo; Achilles pauses to recall the boy&rsquo;s name, &ldquo;Telemachus. How old would he be now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Patroklos thinks for a moment, then says mildly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. It depends how much time has passed up there. I imagine he must be nearly grown by now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Silence again. Then,</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you ever feel like you had more left to do, up above? Like you left things unfinished?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you joking, Achilles?&rdquo; At this, Achilles finally looks up to face his companion. His expression amused, bordering on incredulous. &ldquo;I feel that way constantly. We all do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Right, of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think you were the only one, did you?&rdquo; Patroklos isn&rsquo;t actually laughing at him, but Achilles can sense it, bubbling somewhere in his shadowy form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, no, of course not,&rdquo; he rushes. &ldquo;What I meant was&hellip; I was just thinking that, you know, Odysseus was right: my life and death were everything I could have asked, could have hoped they would be.&rdquo; He turns back to the river.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I fulfilled every prophecy of my birth, completed every task set before me, so matter how great. But I still can&rsquo;t feel at peace with it all. I feel&hellip;&rdquo; he trails off, searching for the words. &ldquo;&hellip; Unsatisfied.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, that makes sense. You were never satisfied in life, it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that you&rsquo;re unsatisfied in death.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I used to hear stories as a child, about dead souls who discovered a way to be reborn into new life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I remember; I heard those same stories.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And?&rdquo; Achilles places his own hand over Patroklos&rsquo;, still resting on his shoulder. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Patroklos reaches his other hand up to hold Achilles&rsquo; chin and </span><span class="c2">pull</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;it gently to face him, forcing his eyes away from the Styx, &ldquo;that before satisfaction comes tiredness. And I am very tired after all of that.&rdquo; He nods his head back at the river, and the opposite shore where Odysseus had disappeared into the mist. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hearing</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">this, Achilles suddenly registers his own deep weariness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the most I&rsquo;ve talked since I was alive,&rdquo; he agrees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Odysseus always was a loquacious sort, that at least hasn&rsquo;t changed.&rdquo; Patroklos smiles. &ldquo;Would you like to go lie down with me and rest?&rdquo; he asks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&mdash;yes. Yes, that sounds good.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Shades do not sleep, per se, not in the same manner that the living do. In a way, shades are always at least partially asleep. But even so, they have many ways of resting.</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c7 c2 c3"></span></p><p class="c9 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
