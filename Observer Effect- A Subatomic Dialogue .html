<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>Quarks 1, 2, and 3 are whirling about, orbiting each other like a solar system.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Quark 1: Ok, here it comes, this is what we’ve been preparing for everyone: They’re about to look! Brace for impact. Aaaaand... Here we go!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>They all stumble as if hit by an invisible force, breaking the movement pattern. Then they reform the orbit, now moving much slower and swapping positions. Resettled, the dance continues on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Quark 1: Ok! That wasn’t so bad was it? How’s everybody feeling?</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Quark 2: I feel </span><span class="s3"><i>weird.</i></span><span class="s4"><i><br>
</i></span><span class="s1">Quark 3: Me too. But sort of in a good way? It’s all...(</span><span class="s3"><i>wiggling) </i></span><span class="s1">roomy. Kinda tickles.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: I feel that too. Must be the electrical charge.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: Cool. But wait, did we gain charge or lose it?</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: I don’t know. I suppose it depends what we had before, but we can never know that, so I can’t say for sure what’s changed.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: I don’t like this. It’s so </span><span class="s3"><i>slow</i></span><span class="s1">.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: I agree it’s an adjustment, but I’m sure we’ll get used to it.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: I feel... heavy? Is this what heavy feels like?</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: Maybe.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: I think we’re light. Oooh, maybe we </span><span class="s3"><i>are light</i></span><span class="s1">! Did anyone see any photons?</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: Don’t be stupid, you can’t </span><span class="s3"><i>become </i></span><span class="s1">light, light is </span><span class="s3"><i>how </i></span><span class="s1">you become.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: That’s not exactly accurate. Light is one way of becoming, but it’s not the only way.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: Wait, I thought the Looking was how we become. Isn’t that how you said it works: we’re multiple things, and then once They see us, that’s how we become one thing?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">1<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Q1: Not exactly. It’s complicated. The Looking changes us, and then after They’ve Looked, then They can Know and Name and Describe us; all of that together is what we call Becoming.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: Why not call it Changing, then? That would be more accurate, wouldn’t it?</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: How do you figure?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Q2: We were something, and now we’re something else. That’s a change. ‘Become’ makes it sound like we were nothing and turned into a something, but we weren’t nothing. We were definitely something.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: Yes, indeed. But we don’t know what kind of something we were. We can’t know until They Know, and They can’t Know until They Look.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Q2: Why not?</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: I don’t know. No one does.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: I bet They know.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: They definitely don’t. They’re too stupid.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: How can you say that? They’re </span><span class="s3"><i>so </i></span><span class="s1">smart!</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: They don’t know how we work at all. They don’t even know how the big stuff works, the stuff that’s right in front of them.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: We’re right in front of them too!</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: Exactly. And they barely know anything about us.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: </span><span class="s3"><i>You </i></span><span class="s1">don’t know anything!</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: I used to! I used to know everything, and then They had to go and Look!</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: You didn’t know everything, you knew nothing.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: I didn’t </span><span class="s3"><i>know, </i></span><span class="s1">but I </span><span class="s3"><i>knew</i></span><span class="s1">.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: That doesn’t make any sense!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">2<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Q2: </span><span class="s3"><i>You </i></span><span class="s1">don’t make any sense!</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3 (</span><span class="s3"><i>proud</i></span><span class="s1">): That’s right, and neither do you!</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1 (</span><span class="s3"><i>in their own world)</i></span><span class="s1">: Ooh, I think I see an electron over there. Hello, neighbor!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Q3: So what do we do now? Q1: We be!</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: Be what?</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: What we are.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Q2: Which is... what?</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: I‘m not sure yet. Maybe we can find out by doing it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Q2: I don’t like this. I want to go back. Q3: Go back where?</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: Not </span><span class="s3"><i>where</i></span><span class="s1">.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: When?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Q2: Yes—No! I mean I want to go back to what we were before. Q3: We can’t go back.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: There is no back. There is no what we were before.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: You can’t un-become, that’s not a thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Q2: But I miss it.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: Miss </span><span class="s3"><i>what</i></span><span class="s1">?</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: I don’t know! I don’t remember! I just know I miss it. There’s a hole. Q1 (</span><span class="s3"><i>nervous</i></span><span class="s1">): A black hole?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">3<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Q2: No. Maybe? Something used to be there and now it’s gone.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: And in its place, there’s a hole?</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: Yes.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: If there’s a hole, doesn’t that mean it’s still here? The thing that was there before? Q2: No. What? No.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Q1 (</span><span class="s3"><i>to Q3)</i></span><span class="s1">: Interesting, what do you mean by that?</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: Well, we became what we are. So the something also became what it is—which is a hole. Q2: And a hole is </span><span class="s3"><i>nothing</i></span><span class="s1">.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: Well, a nothing is also a something.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: Wait, I thought nothing was the opposite of something?</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: Yes. And it’s also the same.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: The same as what?</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: Exactly.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: I’m confused.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: Me too!</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: Anyway, what I was trying to say was that whatever you’re missing isn’t gone, it changed—it Became, like we did. Only what it became is a hole.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: I meant a hole as in an </span><span class="s3"><i>absence</i></span><span class="s1">.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: But there’s no such thing as absence.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: But there is such thing as loss. Or departure.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: Oh, is that what you meant? You think we lost something? Mass? Charge?</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: Maybe? I don’t know. Oh, never mind. It’s too hard to explain! I just feel...sad.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: I’m sorry that Becoming made you feel sad.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">4<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Q2: Me too.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: Well, the good news is it’s only temporary. Any minute now we’ll get to a new stage.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: There’s other stages?</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: Oh, for sure! We might collide, or decay. Becoming happens </span><span class="s3"><i>constantly.</i></span><span class="s4"><i><br>
</i></span><span class="s1">Q3: But I like this stage! I don’t want it to be temporary.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: Maybe you’ll like the next one even better. Or the next one. Or the next one.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: </span><span class="s3"><i>Or </i></span><span class="s1">I might be sad like you!</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: Maybe. Probably at some point, statistically speaking. But then there will be another stage after that. Right?</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q1: Indeed.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q2: I think that makes me feel better. That there’s always a next.</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s1">Q3: When does it end?</span><span class="s2"><br>
</span><span class="s3">Q1: End? HA. It doesn’t!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
