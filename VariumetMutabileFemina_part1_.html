He paced the length of the gardens outside the temple, appreciating the crisp, cool air. While he wandered in aimless contemplation, his beloved wife slept peacefully in their bed, alone. Acerbas had to laugh at his own behavior. Anyone in their right mind would kill to lay beside Elissa for even a few moments, yet instead of rushing home to the princess, tonight he found himself drawn, by some unknowable exhortation, to linger at the temple well into the night. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Just thinking of Elissa, picturing her sleeping form curled like an overdrawn bow around her pillow, sent Acerbas&rsquo; heart floating in his chest. He longed to join her, but he could not ignore the feeling--indeterminate yet intense--that he must stay. He had the strangest notion that if he just remained here a little longer, he would find something&hellip; significant. A physical discovery or an internal revelation, he was not sure, but the notion urged him on regardless. For a man of worship, such an instinct could only be attributed to divinity, and he would not ignore the call.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A breeze swept through the garden, rustling a nearby copse of cedar trees into an ominous chorus. The wind blew in the direction of the temple&rsquo;s main entrance. Acerbas took the hint, abandoning his pensive wanderings to retreat back into the sanctuary of the building&rsquo;s interior. The air inside was staler, but it got noticeably warmer once he passed the grand columns of the entryway, sending his thoughts casting once again to his bed and the hearthfire of Elissa&rsquo;s body next to his. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He crossed the threshold into the main chamber, only to stop short. A figure was standing in the center of the room, just beyond the sacrificial altar. The eternal fire, burning dangerously low, emitted a small range of orange light from the opposite wall, outlining a silhouette in the shape of a man made of denser shadow than the rest of the darkness in the large room. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Acerbas jumped, just managing to bite his tongue around a yelp of surprise. No one else was supposed to be here at this hour. His first thought, after the initial shock, was of some kind of apparition, perhaps a vision from Melqart. </span><span class="c4 c9">This</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;must be why he&rsquo;d felt compelled not to return home: so he could receive a message from his god. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Acerbas stepped forward, approaching the figure cautiously. His footsteps echoed in the silence, but the spirit did not turn or flinch. Heart thudding in his throat, he came up on its right side, keeping a suitable, respectful distance of several feet. At last, he drew near enough to see the shadow&rsquo;s profile, illuminated by the flames, and his heart sank back into its proper place&mdash;half in disappointment, half in relief. This was no divine messenger, but his very human brother-in-law. Nevertheless, Acerbas maintained his respectful distance and inclined his head in acknowledgement of the king. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;King Pygmalion, I did not expect to see you here at such a late hour. Is everything alright?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The king continued staring into the fire. The low light cast stark lines over his features, like the planes of his face were painted in blocks of harsh orange and deepest black. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Everything is fine. I just felt compelled to visit the temple tonight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Acerbas smiled. &ldquo;I know the feeling.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But since I&rsquo;m here, I would seek your counsel, my dear brother, if you don&rsquo;t mind indulging me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Acerbas stepped closer. Pygmalion&rsquo;s voice was so soft, he could barely make out the words. The king normally spoke imperiously, with booming command that erased any notion of weakness or doubt. Hearing him like this, so quiet and hesitant, meant that whatever was troubling him must be quite serious. Even more concerning, he had come alone, with no guards whatsoever.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Acerbas drew close to Pygmalion&rsquo;s side. He had his quarrels with the king, this was no secret, but he welcomed the opportunity to be a confidant for whatever was troubling him.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Whatever you need.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are a wise man,&rdquo; the king continued, his eyes still fixed on the hearth. &ldquo;And I have a quandary that requires great wisdom.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am happy to offer whatever advice I can.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You see, my problem is this.&rdquo; Pygmalion turned his gaze to Acerbus at last. &ldquo;I am the King of Tyre. I command its armies and control its dealings. I do everything in my power to rule this city with good judgement. To do right by its people.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As he spoke, the ever-shrinking fire caused the shadows on his face to grow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;Yet I find myself constantly undermined. At the crossroads of every decision I make as king, there is an undeniable fact lurking around the corner that there is one more powerful in this city than I.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Acerbas frowned. &ldquo;Who could possibly&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Power is slippery, you know. So ephemeral&mdash;hard to gain, so very easy to lose. The smallest bribe in the right hands has the potential to topple kingdoms, and the men who sit atop them. I fear such an occasion. These fears keep me up at night, bleed into nightmares that feel like premonitions. Do you know whose face I see in those nightmares, Acerbas?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light continued to fade as the eternal fire shrank down to a final flame among cinders. Acerbas ached to walk over and </span><span class="c4">stoke</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it back to life, as was his duty, but Pygmalion was blocking his way. As the darkness thickened, shadows overtook Pygmalion&rsquo;s face with shades of black and gray, the only color in his features the glinting reflection of the fire in his eyes. His red gaze froze Acerbas&rsquo; feet to the floor.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Look at this place!&rdquo; Pygmalion&rsquo;s voice grew to a shout without warning. He swept his arms around the temple with a dry laugh, waving almost maniacally at the doorway set in the western-most wall, behind which the city&rsquo;s coffers were housed. Acerbas might have jumped at the sudden sound and movement, if he weren&rsquo;t so frozen by fear. The last of the fire was reduced to embers now, robbing the chamber of its previous warmth. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gold and emerald columns at the entrance, rooms full of riches. All the city&rsquo;s funds, a treasury of worship to our good patron god. And who controls it all?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Though</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the firelight was all but gone, a flaming spark continued to gleam in Pygmalion&rsquo;s eye.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not I. Not the king. You cut me out of our city&rsquo;s finances more and more each day, Acerbas. I won&rsquo;t be manipulated any more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Acerbas managed one step backward. &ldquo;My king, I was only trying to ease your burden&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You were lining your own pockets!&rdquo; The shout reverberated through the chamber. &ldquo;I am not a vindictive man. I could forgive your machinations, if I did not know you also hoard a fortune of your own that could buy my army out from under me. Oh yes, I know all about your hidden treasure.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; Acerbas&rsquo; voice faltered to silence as his eyes caught sight of another spark of light. The darkness was complete enough now to hide the movement of Pygmalion reaching a hand beneath his robes, but the last vestige of orange light from the embers caught the knife he produced, bouncing wickedly off its blade. Acerbas stumbled back again. As he rushed to retreat, not daring to take his eyes off Pygmalion, the backs of his legs hit the hard stone of the altar. Before Acerbas could correct his course, Pygmalion whipped around with incredible speed. He slammed Acerbas down onto the altar, pinning him with a strength Acerbas hadn&rsquo;t known he possessed. It was the strength of a man who has made a decision he won&rsquo;t be talked out of. One arm pressed against Acerbas&rsquo; chest, the knife in hand </span><span class="c4">threatening</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to graze across his ribs through his thin priest&rsquo;s robe. The other hand wrapped around his throat.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know better than to try and torture the location out of you. Pious men are always so resolute. But once you are gone, it should be easy to find myself. I daresay that without you whispering in her ear, my sister will be easily persuaded to give up your secrets.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Acerbas choked around a plea, but he had no opportunity to persuade the king that Elissa knew nothing of his hidden wealth. Pygmalion&#39;s grip stayed firm around his throat as he plunged the dagger deep into his chest. He pulled it roughly out and stabbed down again for good measure, in the same spot. And again, just because it felt good. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Acerbas blood seeped and spread across the altar like so many sacrificial animals&rsquo;, the very last, lingering ember in the hearth snuffed out. Under cover of pure darkness, Pygmalion wiped his blade clean and secured it back in its hidden sheath. He retreated from the temple with a brusk, purposeful gate, all trace of murder or malice absent from his empty expression. Upon seeing their king emerge, two royal guards, whom Pygmalion had ordered to stay behind, stepped out of the shadows. He gave them a nod and a curt gesture, a predetermined signal. The guards, loyal and obedient as they come, retraced his footsteps back into the temple.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Inside, the only sound in the vast chamber was Acerbas&rsquo; final, choking breaths, his lips moving soundlessly around his wife&rsquo;s name. The guards passed by him without a glance at first, intent on that western room which housed the treasury and sacrifices to Melqart. Pygmalion had promised them their pick as insurance for their discretion. They filled their satchels to the brim with coins and gems, golden statuettes and jewel-encrusted bowls, while Acerbas&rsquo; rasping faded to silence in the next chamber. When they were finished, they returned to heft his limp body up from the altar. Even weighed down by their pilfered bribes, they had strength to spare between them for a corpse. It was an easy feat to carry Acerbas&rsquo; body to the pyre Pygmalion had set up ahead of time, hidden way out in the woods. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Safe in her bed, Elissa&rsquo;s eyes flashed open suddenly, ripped from sleep by an unknown force and plunged instantly into a sourceless sense of foreboding. Outside her window, a distant plume of smoke, no thicker than a length of thread and camouflaged by the fog of night, rose over Tyre.</span></p><hr><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The disappearance of a leading priest was impossible to hide, but Pygmalion had his story well prepared. In the following weeks, his plan fell into perfect place, and he watched it unfold from his throne with satisfaction. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rumors of Acerbas&rsquo; hidden wealth had long circulated through Tyre, even before they had reached the king&rsquo;s ears and incited him to jealous violence. The existing gossip played well with the report of items missing from the treasury. Pygmalion let the news spread naturally, barely needing to lift a finger for a story to form in the minds of the people&mdash;the same narrative that Pygmalion had told himself, of a greedy, selfish man hiding behind the facade of a kindly priest. By the time the king&rsquo;s council officially announced Acerbas&rsquo; treacherous theft and subsequent flight from the city, it was only confirming the conclusion so many had come to on their own.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But not everyone. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elissa was far from ignorant of the malignant rumors spreading about her husband, but she had no patience for them, too certain of his good character to believe a word. Pygmalion&rsquo;s deceptions could infect those who were only passingly familiar with Acerbas, but they rang patently false to anyone who&rsquo;d known him personally. The more the people of Tyre became convinced that Acerbas had robbed them and fled into the night, the stronger Elissa&rsquo;s fear for her husband grew.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the weeks following Acerbas&rsquo; disappearance, Elissa saw more of her brother than she had perhaps in all the years since he&rsquo;d replaced their father as king of Tyre. She sought him out daily for updates in the investigation, desperate for even the smallest scrap of news as to her husband&rsquo;s wellbeing. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Pygmalion skirted her requests. He enjoyed stringing her along, wallowing in his own cleverness as he danced around her questions with the vaguest platitudes he could come up with, all the while dropping hints and insinuations&mdash;wondering aloud why Acerbas would need to steal from the treasury when his family was so wealthy. Each time, he searched her face closely for a reaction, an opening to get her talking about the hidden cache of riches.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His implications were lost on Elissa, but his self-satisfaction was all too evident. Every dodging assurance that &ldquo;I have people looking into it,&rdquo; or &ldquo;We&rsquo;re close to finding him,&rdquo; only raised her suspicion, feeding into a terrible theory that she couldn&rsquo;t quite dismiss. Though she had no evidence, she felt a certainty deep in her soul: whatever had happened to her husband, Pygmalion was, somehow, responsible. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even with this conviction, and knowing the extent of her brother&rsquo;s vindictive streak, she couldn&rsquo;t help but hope&mdash;he had run Acerbas off, forced him into hiding. Somewhere, her husband was alive, and she would be reunited with him. This hope fluttered in her heart like a candle&rsquo;s flame, weak and trembling, threatening to snuff out at every turn. She tended to it diligently, feeding it with the roaring inferno of her rage.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elissa was not a wrathful person by nature, but she had always been a quick study. The art of hatred was no exception, and her brother was an excellent teacher.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">She was not in the room when Pygmalion formalized the accusation, declaring Acerbas a thief and a traitor before the court. Her presence was not welcome </span><span class="c4">near</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;official matters of state. Though their father had named Pygmalion and Elissa his equal heirs, Pygmalion was the one who sat on the throne, and he preferred to keep the business of governance far from her, as well as their younger sister, Anna. The stress of such matters would surely vex a woman&rsquo;s constitution, he insisted, and neither was to concern herself with it. Anna had no interest in politics, with or without their brother&rsquo;s approval. Elissa had found ways to circumvent him.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She settled for feeding words of wisdom and policy through second-hand channels. In the years since her father&rsquo;s passing and Pygmalion&rsquo;s rise to king, she had built a rapport with the members of the council, slowly gaining their trust through seemingly casual conversation. By now, it was second nature for her to catch one of the king&rsquo;s advisors in idle discussion, and slip in a comment about modifications to the division of labor or distributions of funds, so innocuously that it never occurred to the poor fellow that the idea came from anywhere but his own political genius. In exchange, they shared insights from throne room conversations which Elissa was locked out of&mdash;some did so out of a genuine desire to keep her updated, some were just boasting under the assumption that they were spilling secrets to a silly girl who couldn&rsquo;t even understand what they told her. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was during one such conversation that one of Pygmalion&rsquo;s closest counselors let slip the news to her that Pygmalion had made Acerbas&rsquo; treachery the official narrative. Her rage burned white-hot and vast as the sun.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night, the king slept soundly, pleased by the triumph of his scheme and confident in its next steps. Alone in the home and bed she had once shared with her husband, Elissa tossed and turned for hours, eventually drifting into sleep with all the smoothness of a skiff in a storm.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When she next opened her eyes, seconds or perhaps hours later, there was a shade of a figure sitting next to her in bed. Through bleary-eyed sleep, she recognized the dim form&mdash;as much as it could be recognized. Finding details in this shadow of a man was like spotting the new moon through a cloud, but she had yearned to see even a trace of her husband for so long. There was no chance of her mistaking it as he appeared to her now. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My love&mdash;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The words fell from her lips and quickly turned to sobs. Since Acerbas had vanished, all her passion had taken the form of fiery rage, but it transmuted at the sight of him into a storm of grief and longing. She lunged to wrap herself around him, determined to hold on tight enough that he could never leave her side again. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Her arms did not so much pass through him as his form slipped from her touch, the way a shadow </span><span class="c4">shies</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;away from light.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She wept with the force of a tempest. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I touch you?&rdquo; she pleaded falteringly through the squall. Acerbas&rsquo; voice was a gentle zephyr amid her hurricane.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I beg you believe me, my darling: if I were able to touch you now, you would grow tired of my embrace in no time. Unfortunately, this is the only form I have to appear to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With the care of dipping a toe into freezing water, Elissa tried again to touch him, this time reaching out a hand to gently graze his cheek. As living flesh approached ghostly shade, his gray skin melted from existence. Nothing had ever been there except for empty air, until she&rsquo;d moved to occupy the space herself. She pulled her hand back, and his face was whole again. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is a dream,&rdquo; she said brokenly. &ldquo;And you are dead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;A dream, a vision. Who can say what makes the difference</span><span class="c4">. But</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to the second part&hellip;&rdquo;Acerbas merely nodded, and although it came as no surprise, having her deepest fear confirmed sent an ice-cold sword through Elissa&rsquo;s heart. Her candle of hope went dark.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I knew it.&rdquo; Tears continued to stream down her face, a downpour. &ldquo;Deep down, I knew.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Acerbas lifted his hands to his chest, pulling the fabric of his tunic where Pygmalion&rsquo;s knife had torn through it to show her the wound beneath. The bloodstain was nearly invisible in the gray on gray shades of death, but the gash still </span><span class="c4">marred</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;his chest, fresh and twisted and grisly. Elissa gasped, a sound equally horrified, pitiful, and viciously angry. Forgetting herself, she reached out to hold him again, this time a touch of comfort for him instead of for her. Her arms stopped inches short of his phantom shape, and she drew back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who did this to you?&rdquo; Ready to hear her theory confirmed, her voice shook with a fury meant only for the gods.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The king.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elissa&rsquo;s hands tightened into fists around her sheets, and it was only the thin fabric that prevented her nails from digging gouges into her palms. A scream of rage begged to be released from her throat, but she kept it down. Ghost or not, Acerbas did not need to see her lose control. She would save that for her brother.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Acerbas spoke again quickly, as though he knew the terrible thoughts running through her head, the impossible plans for revenge.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You have to leave, Elissa. It isn&rsquo;t safe. I have money hidden, enough to get you out of Tyre and set up someplace else, far from him.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what this has all been about, has it? Money?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Acerbas nodded again. &ldquo;Your brother has always been plagued by avarice. Power has made him even greedier as king. When your father gave you to me in marriage, I feared his jealousy&mdash;rightly so, as it turns out. Before our wedding, I stashed some funds away where Pygmalion could not get his hands on them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t tell me, not even in all the years since? Why? Didn&rsquo;t you trust me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Acerbas hung his head, not immune to shame even in death.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was foolish. When we married, I&hellip; I loved you beyond all reason, but you know as well as I that your father orchestrated our union to gain my family&rsquo;s resources.&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You doubted my love for you?&rdquo; Elissa&rsquo;s voice was hoarse, both from sobs and from the way his words tore at her already mangled heart. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I feared that your devotion was a facade, at the behest of your family. I kept the money as a contingency, in case the bonds of blood were stronger than the bonds of marriage.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Under his lowered head, his expression as he spoke was as impassive as granite. In her hurt and grief, Elissa wondered if this spirit truly was her beloved Acerbas. In life, he had been so expressive, so compassionate. This shade wore her husband&rsquo;s face, but it resembled him the way a statue resembles its model. Cold. Fixed. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&ldquo;I grew to trust you,&rdquo; he continued, his words heartfelt but his tone a flat slab of marble. &ldquo;Your love shone bright enough to cast off my insecurities. But as time went on, the secret grew more distant, less real to me. Eventually, it seemed pointless to even mention. And despite my guilt, I cannot bring myself to regret my </span><span class="c4">lie</span><span class="c0">. If you&rsquo;d known the truth, you might have already met my same fate.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anger and grief wrestled in Elissa&mdash;fire and ice at war, and her soul was the battleground.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;Ignorance is no protection.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not anymore, it isn&rsquo;t. Pygmalion will kill you eventually, whether you bring him my gold or not. I am certain of it. Escape is your only hope. Once you have the money, you&rsquo;ll be able to make a home wherever you please, as far away from Tyre as you can.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Something in Elissa ached to protest that she had to stay. That she had to see Pygmalion punished for his crimes. That she could not abandon her city to his tyranny.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That no matter where she went, she could make no home without Acerbas by her side. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But she said none of this. This eerily composed image of her husband was no trick, she realized. His blankness was pragmatism made manifest, sending her a message. Cool your passions, and see clearly through the fog.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The money is in Sidonia, buried under ground. You&rsquo;ll know the spot by my mark. Please, my darling,&rdquo; he said, and she could feel the truth of his love, even though she could not see or hear it. &ldquo;Please save yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><hr><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The next morning, a courier arrived from the palace, sent by Pygmalion to summon Elissa. Caught off guard, Elissa instructed him to wait outside, insisting that she had to change into better attire to greet the king. She needed a minute alone to prepare, head still reeling from last night&rsquo;s vision, and Acerbas&rsquo; warnings fresh in her mind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She took her time, drawing out the process of dressing as if she were truly concerned with the state of her appearance. She wrapped her dress slowly around herself&mdash;patriotic purple, the sign of wealth and royalty. Her own private, vindictive joke. All the while she adorned herself, she imagined she was donning armor. She certainly felt like she was about to go into battle. As she sat in front of the mirror, pinning her hair up with automatic movements, her eyes were fixed on the reflection of her face, practicing the polite mask she would show to her brother. She was well practiced by now in hiding her anger and suspicion, but the wounds of Acerbas&rsquo; revelations were fresh and raw. She could not risk a sliver of her true feelings to crack through. With a final, calming breath, she emerged ready to face her combatant.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They reached the palace quickly, and the courier led her not to the throne room, but to Pygmalion&rsquo;s private chambers. The guard standing at his door waved her through. Inside, it was just her brother, alone.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He rose from his chair, a simpering smile plastered on his face, reeking of false sympathy. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elissa spoke before he could open his mouth, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rare that you seek me out, brother. To what do I owe the pleasure?&rdquo; Her voice snagged on the polite tone she forced herself to maintain.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Pygmalion heaved a melodramatic sigh. Elissa fought not to roll her eyes, unmoved by his theatrics.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Though his performance was lacking, the words that followed still chilled her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I have more unfortunate news to deliver,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I would have told you yesterday, but I wanted to give you a chance to process things. Sadly, I cannot hold it off any longer. The truth is, if we cannot find Acerbas&mdash;and it seems unlikely, as we have no indications of where he has fled to&mdash;the consequences of his thievery must fall to his next of kin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He let the implicit threat hang in the air a moment. The punishment for stealing from the treasury was death. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Pygmalion paused, waiting for her to respond. He expected to hear her grovel and plead for him to intervene on her behalf, setting him up to deliver the rest of his speech. But it was written plain as day on his face that he had more to say, and Elissa remained resolutely silent, unwilling to perform her part in the script.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The silence stretched on between them. Impatient Pygmalion conceded first.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There might be another way,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;If the debt is repaid somehow, perhaps there would be no need for a sentence.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Repaid?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. If you can somehow compensate the treasury for the value of what your husband took, then this matter could be resolved.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There it was. It was a fairly transparent plan, but perhaps she might have fallen for it if he had caught her yesterday, before Acerbas visited her dreams with the truth of his hidden wealth. It was only now, in retrospect, that she understood all Pygmalion&rsquo;s attempts to pry the location out of her up until now. Clearly, he&rsquo;d grown tired of subtlety.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Acerbas&rsquo; warnings rang in her ears. Much as she trusted her vision, it was only now that the threat Pygmalion posed to her felt real. There had never been any love lost between her and her brother, but even still, it had been hard to imagine that he would truly harm her, much less kill her. Now, here he stood, having orchestrated her death sentence unless she capitulated to his greed, and she had no doubts he would follow through. Her choices were deliver or escape.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Swallowing down the sour bile of fear, Elissa choked out, &ldquo;How long do I have? To come up with the money?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can grant you another few days, perhaps. A week at most.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elissa breathed deeply. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;A week </span><span class="c4">it is</span><span class="c0">, then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Pygmalion nodded, failing to hide his satisfaction. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A week. I hope you can find the money, Elissa. I really do.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He waved a hand towards the door, dismissing her. As she turned and walked back through the door, she kept herself calm by picturing slitting his pompous throat. It was a fruitless wish, but imagining it made the tightness in her chest ease by a fraction. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One week. Seven days to make her plan. It would have to do.</span></p><hr><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first person Elissa recruited to her endeavor was her sister. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She expected Anna to balk at her story, to question her vision from Acerbas, perhaps even defend their brother against the terrible accusations.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Instead, Anna listened without interruption, her eyes wide. At the end of the tale, Elissa collapsed into a chair, exhausted by the recounting and shaking with emotion.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She felt a weight settle next to her. Warm arms wrapped around her trembling shoulders, and sweet lips pressed a gentle kiss to her temple.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You poor, poor dear,&rdquo; Anna soothed. Her sympathy was a blow to the weak point in the dam that Elissa had built against her grief and fear. The wall collapsed, and it all came flooding out of her in gasping sobs that felt like they might never subside. Through it all, Anna sat by her, stroking her hair and whispering soft words of comfort.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know Acerbas is right,&rdquo; she said when Elissa&rsquo;s tears finally abated. &ldquo;You must leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;</span><span class="c4 c9">We</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;must leave,&rdquo; Elissa responded. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t abandon you to face Pygmalion alone. I have a plan, but we have to work quickly. And I&rsquo;ll need your help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anna nodded. &ldquo;Tell me what you need me to do, and it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t just be us,&rdquo; Elissa began. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re to do this successfully, we need manpower. Sailors, fighters, trackers.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How many people do you imagine?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As many as we can get.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anna cocked her head. &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t need more than a handful to travel to Sidonia, or to retrieve Acerbas&rsquo; cache. A smaller party would be easier to sneak out of the city.&rdquo; She narrowed her eyes. &ldquo;What are you really planning?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not just going to Sidonia. Pygmalion would find us there if we stayed. After we retrieve the money, we&rsquo;ll need to go much farther. Out of Phoenicia altogether.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Though Elissa was still facing her, Anna suddenly got the sense that her sister was not really seeing her. She had a hardened, far-away look in her eyes, like she was looking at something miles away. Something that only she could see. Something that might not even be there yet.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elissa?&rdquo; Anna whispered, almost reverently.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t live the rest of my life hiding from him. I won&rsquo;t let him take my city from me.&rdquo; Elissa continued staring into that distance. Her jaw was set, sticking out like a stubborn promontory against a relentless tide. There was an unidentifiable gleam in her bloodshot eyes. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make Tyre anew. A city free from his cruelty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">She blinked, and her gaze returned to the present moment, </span><span class="c4">though</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;her eyes retained that spark, a shine of ambition that thrilled and scared Anna in equal measure.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to build an escape party. I want to start a civilization.&rdquo; She spoke with a weight of authority that made it sound less like a wish and more like a promise. &ldquo;That takes many more people. Will you help me find them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anna chose to listen to that authority, and ignore her fear. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was, fortunately, no shortage of potential allies for their venture. Pygmalion had angered plenty of his citizens in his years as king, some even among his own council. The key was finding ways to speak to them without a word catching Pygmalion&rsquo;s ear.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Elissa especially had to be careful who she talked to, and when. She knew her brother was keeping a watch on her. Not himself, of course, but she noticed the guards that tailed her at a distance through the days, no doubt reporting her movements back to Pygmalion. He had trapped her into delivering Acerbas treasure directly to him </span><span class="c4">on pain</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of death, but apparently he wasn&rsquo;t taking any chances, ready to track her movements to its location and seize it himself. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Luckily, it was no odd sight for her to walk and chat with the king&rsquo;s advisors, and she had plenty of practice at political doublespeak. She knew exactly who within Pygmalion&rsquo;s inner circle harbored resentment towards their king, and how to target them without arousing suspicion. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna did not have the same political sway that her sister had cultivated, but the time that Elissa had spent whispering in the ears of senators, Anna had built a rapport with the lower workers: the guards and messengers and servants of the palace. They might not have the direct ear of the king, but they had practical skills, and knew others who did. Anna knew who among them could be trusted, and just what scraps of information to provide that would persuade them: a page whose family had been denied a life-saving loan by the council. A cupbearer who so feared Pygmalion&rsquo;s raised hand that he would take any chance to flee the city. A devout guard who nursed suspicions about what had really happened to the disappeared high priest. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Between them, the two sisters gathered a contingent of dissidents, enough to sustain Elissa&rsquo;s plan. The problem was getting them all out of the city without alerting the king. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The days until Pygmalion&rsquo;s deadline flew by as they worked, and Elissa&rsquo;s panic mounted with each setting sun. Everything depended on finding the cache&mdash;without it, their fledgling colony would never make it out of Phoenicia. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Amid all their preparations, no one thought to question Elissa on the location of the treasure. It would be foolish to spread such a secret, of course, so no one bothered to try. But she couldn&rsquo;t have told them even if she wanted to.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The eve of their departure arrived, and Elissa still had no idea what Acerbas&rsquo; had meant when he said she would know the hiding spot by his &ldquo;mark.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">Reflection: My original idea was to adapt the story of Aeneas and Dido, but upon rereading that part of the </span><span class="c1">Aeneid, </span><span class="c11">I found a passage that summarized Dido&rsquo;s backstory before the events of the poem, and decided that that sounded like a much more interesting endeavor to adapt. The lack of details meant I would have more creative freedom, and it allowed me to tell a part of the story that hadn&rsquo;t really been told before, at least not in detail. This changed a lot of the process, as I now had to do a lot more outside research. This story is set in a different part of the Ancient World (Phoenicia), which I had little background knowledge about, and not much information is provided in the </span><span class="c1">Aeneid</span><span class="c11">. Researching gave me a lot of good details to add (like the Phoenician names of these characters, different from the Romanizations Vergil used), and it also changed the scope of the story I was telling. My research led me to Vergil&rsquo;s primary source, the Roman historian Justin&rsquo;s </span><span class="c1">Philipic Histories,</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;which provides a different, more detailed version of Dido/Elissa&rsquo;s backstory, including events beyond what&rsquo;s mentioned in the </span><span class="c1">Aeneid</span><span class="c11">. I had a choice ahead of me: I could use the </span><span class="c1">Aeneid</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;as my only basis and continue filling in the blanks with my own invention, or I could try to merge what&rsquo;s in the poem and what&rsquo;s in the history. I went with the latter, because by then I had done a lot of research and was invested in using it. &ldquo;Historically accurate&rdquo; is a kind of a fool&rsquo;s errand when you&rsquo;re working in an era where so many accounts blend history and mythology, but I felt a kind of responsibility to present a holistic if not &ldquo;accurate&rdquo; picture of the story. This choice meant I had a lot more ground to cover in order to include the details from Justin which Vergil ellided, so what I&rsquo;ve written here is very much only the beginning of the story. I&rsquo;m going to say Part 1 of 3, although that might be a conservative estimate. This idea turned out to be a much bigger endeavor than I imagined, definitely not one I could complete in a few weeks, but I would love to continue this story to the end. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11">The feedback from my presentation mostly reiterated my own thoughts about this story, but it was still helpful to hear them from an outside perspective&ndash;&ndash;I find that the more I go over and over my own writing, the harder it can be to imagine what it looks like to a reader, and I certainly went over this piece many, many times. My main takeaways are that I&rsquo;m in a good place stylistically, and that my attempts to evoke a Classical/Homeric tone were successful, which was my main goal through this process. Important things to consider going forward will be clarifying the cause and effect of action, strengthening characterization, and considering more about the themes I want to present. However, my first roadblock to writing the next sections will be figuring out how to make all the plot holes in </span><span class="c1">Philipic Histories </span><span class="c11">make any sense. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3 c6"><span class="c10"></span></p></body></html>
