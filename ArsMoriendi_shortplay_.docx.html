BRAM and HARRIET sit on a bench. BRAM is dressed in army fatigues and constantly fidgets. Over the course of the play, the lights dim gradually, mimicking a sunset.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM </span><span class="c1">(pointing)</span><span class="c2">: What about that one?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Hmm. He&rsquo;s visiting his mother. She died of a heart attack. It was sudden, but clean. He&rsquo;s avoided visiting since the funeral, but he&rsquo;s finally ready.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Wow. </span><span class="c1">(Pointing another direction) </span><span class="c2">And that one?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Grandfather. Dementia. He died in the nursing home, surrounded by family- children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews. A death full of love.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: How do you do that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET </span><span class="c1">(Shrugging)</span><span class="c2">: You just make it up. Nothin&rsquo; to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: But you don&rsquo;t even need to think about it. You come up with these whole scenes just like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: I&rsquo;ve been doin&rsquo; this a while, kid. Got lotsa practice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: How long have you been here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Hmmm. Hard to say. The years all blur together after a bit. Could be forever. Could be not long at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: And you do this a lot? Watch them come and go?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Whole lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Do you do&hellip; anything else?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET </span><span class="c1">(chuckling)</span><span class="c2">: There ain&rsquo;t much else to do. Death ain&rsquo;t a cruise ship, boy. There&rsquo;s no jam-packed schedule of activities to choose from</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">BRAM begins jiggling his leg.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You gettin&rsquo; antsy there boy?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: A little.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Get up, stretch your legs. Take a walk. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She sweeps her arms around, indicating the expanse of space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Plenty of ground to tread. And it&rsquo;s all yours.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">BRAM stands up and begins to walk, but turns back abruptly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Why do I still feel? I shouldn&rsquo;t be able to get &ldquo;antsy&rdquo; without a body, should I?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Why&rsquo;re you asking me, boy? You think I know how all this works? I got here just the same way as you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Hardly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Our circumstances may have been a bit different, granted. But after that last moment, we all take the same path. We both ended up here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: What&rsquo;s wrong? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Well that ain&rsquo;t true. I may not&rsquo;ve known you too long but you wear your heart on your sleeve, and your feelings all over your face. What&rsquo;s wrong?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM </span><span class="c1">(The dam exploding)</span><span class="c2">: What </span><span class="c1">isn&rsquo;t</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;wrong!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Calm down. It ain&rsquo;t as bad as you think.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: That&rsquo;s easy for you to say. You clearly had plenty of time to live. </span><span class="c1">(Pause) </span><span class="c2">Um, no offense?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: You think you can insult a dead woman by telling her she looks old?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">BRAM shrugs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You&rsquo;re a good kid. But you&rsquo;re too wound up. Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ve got plenty of time to unwind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: I don&rsquo;t want to unwind! I don&rsquo;t want to sit here on a bench watching the bereaved come and go, day after day, making up stories about what dead loved one they&rsquo;re coming to cry over! I want to </span><span class="c1">do</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;things. I want&hellip; I want more life. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: We all wanted more life. You think I was ready to go? No one&rsquo;s ready to go. You could knock on every tombstone in this place and ask, and not a single one of &lsquo;em will tell you they were ready to say goodbye to livin&rsquo;. And if they do, they&rsquo;re a liar. Like ol&rsquo; Gladys.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She jerks her thumb at a particular grave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Old bitch.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The sound of wind blowing, suddenly loud for a moment. It sounds a little like a woman saying &ldquo;Fuck you, Harriet!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Screw you too, Gladys!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">HARRIET sticks her tongue out at the grave. BRAM watches this all, perplexed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Is everyone buried here a ghost? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: I&rsquo;m not sure. I never counted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: But there are others?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Oh, sure. There&rsquo;s Gladys, and Seymour, and Fiona, and Isaac, and Sir William&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Then how come I can only see you? Shouldn&rsquo;t there be people everywhere?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: I keep tellin&rsquo; you, I don&rsquo;t know how it all works. They didn&rsquo;t give me a guidebook when I got here, either</span><span class="c1">.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;You figure it out as you go along. The others&rsquo;ll start popping up eventually. We all tend to sort of fluctuate in how </span><span class="c1">present </span><span class="c2">we can be. You&rsquo;re new, so you&rsquo;re still fulla that life stuff. You could probably go up to one of these breathin&rsquo; folks an&rsquo; rustle their hair a bit. But you start to settle into things after a while. And then you sorta </span><span class="c1">come</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c1">go</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and such. Not much of a pattern to it. Least as far as I&rsquo;ve noticed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: What does it feel like? When you&hellip; settle?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Don&rsquo;t feel like much at all. Just happens.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: And then what?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: I imagine eventually you stop comin&rsquo; and just go. Like I said, time ain&rsquo;t an exact science here. But, far as I can tell, we don&rsquo;t got anybody from a </span><span class="c1">real</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;long time ago. They&rsquo;re gone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Gone where?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: You gotta stop asking questions I can&rsquo;t answer! I don&rsquo;t know what happens afterwards any more than you do. Any more than I knew that this was waitin&rsquo; for me when I snuffed it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Did you believe in an afterlife? When you were&hellip; alive?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: When I was younger, I reckon. Towards the end, I wasn&rsquo;t so sure. I still thought there was </span><span class="c1">somethin&rsquo;</span><span class="c2">, ya know. But not exactly this. And not exactly all that heaven and hell nonsense. What about you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: I didn&rsquo;t believe in anything. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Just one and done?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: One and done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Huh. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">They are silent for a long moment. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Aw, hell. What&rsquo;s wrong now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Bullshit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: I was just&hellip; thinking about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: &lsquo;Bout what?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: </span><span class="c1">It. </span><span class="c2">The &ldquo;moment,&rdquo; or whatever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Ah. Best not to dwell on that, if ya ask me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: I can&rsquo;t seem to stop. It&rsquo;s like it&rsquo;s all I can see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Show me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: What?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Show me. You already told me, but I wanna see it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">BRAM unbuttons the topmost buttons of his uniform and pulls the collar down to reveal </span><span class="c4">several </span><span class="c1">bullet wounds in his chest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Damn, that&rsquo;s a nasty one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: It hurt? When they shot ya?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Oh yeah. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: How &lsquo;bout now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Kind of. It&rsquo;s&hellip; distant, though. I can still feel it, but it feels far away. It&rsquo;s weird. I don&rsquo;t want to feel it. I would&rsquo;ve thought the one good thing about dying is it doesn&rsquo;t hurt anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: It&rsquo;ll pass. Trust me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">She points to a scar on her forehead, the faint remnants of a head wound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: That&rsquo;s yours?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Sure is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: It healed?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Not so much. S&rsquo;more like you forget. And it goes away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: How&rsquo;d you get it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: None of your damn business, boy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Sorry. (</span><span class="c1">Switching tactics) </span><span class="c2">How long did it take? To go away?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: How many &ldquo;time&rdquo; questions you gonna ask me before you get it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Right. Sorry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: It won&rsquo;t be too long. At least, I don&rsquo;t think it was too long for me. It&rsquo;s not the same for everybody, I reckon. Sir William&rsquo;s still got his, bloody and shiny as the day they ran that sword through him. But that&rsquo;s just him. </span><span class="c1">I</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;think he keeps it around on purpose. Likes to show it off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: I thought you said there wasn&rsquo;t anyone here from a long time ago?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: I said I didn&rsquo;t think there was. And I said from a </span><span class="c1">real</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;long time ago. But Sir William&rsquo;s different. Don&rsquo;t you worry about Sir William. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: I&rsquo;m a little worried. How long ago is Sir William from? How long does it take to pass on?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: How long, how long he says! Years, time- you gotta let go of all that, Bram. It takes however long it takes. S&rsquo;different for everyone. But Sir William </span><span class="c1">sticks.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;He </span><span class="c1">holds on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: He chooses to stay?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Eh, more or less I suppose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Why?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: He likes it here. He&rsquo;s not the only one. S&rsquo;nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Do you like it here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: What&rsquo;s not to like?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Plenty. But I meant&hellip; Are you&hellip;. &lsquo;Holding on?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: So what if I am?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Well, don&rsquo;t you want to move on?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: What&rsquo;s the hurry?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: This is&hellip; well, boring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Hah! Boring!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: And you think whatever&rsquo;s next is gonna be a barrel of laughs?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: No. I mean, maybe. It could be anything, but anything&rsquo;s better than just&hellip; waiting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: I don&rsquo;t see it that way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: No?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: It&rsquo;s only boring if you let it be, if you&rsquo;re only focused on what&rsquo;s to come. Keep trying to speed things up, and they&rsquo;ll only go slower. I intend to enjoy my time here, however much of it I got.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Enjoy it how? People-watching?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: What&rsquo;s wrong with people-watching? You seemed to like it plenty before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Sure, but not for, like, eternity. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: It ain&rsquo;t eternity. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: I want to do something </span><span class="c1">real.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Real how? What&rsquo;s that even mean? </span><span class="c1">We&rsquo;re</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;not real, ff you think about it. Not really here. Not really people. There ain&rsquo;t no livin&rsquo;, and there ain&rsquo;t no doin&rsquo;. Just </span><span class="c1">bein&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Then how do I&hellip; &lsquo;just be?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: You could start by sittin&rsquo; down.

BRAM sits.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Now tell me, what is it you wanted to do in life?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: I wanted a lot of things. To see the world. To make my parents proud. To be a hero. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: That why you joined the army?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: All right, let&rsquo;s try somethin&rsquo;. I want you to picture everythin&rsquo; you wanted to accomplish in life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM </span><span class="c1">(Closing his eyes)</span><span class="c2">: Ok.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: All your grand hopes and dreams.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: All right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: You picturin&rsquo; &lsquo;em?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: Some of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Good. Now smash those pictures with a hammer, and tell me what you did for fun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">BRAM: For fun?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">HARRIET: Yes, fun. Surely you&rsquo;ve heard of it. How did you unwind?

Now I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; that&rsquo;s bad. I&rsquo;m sure you did a lot of good in life. But that was life. Now you&rsquo;re dead. There&rsquo;s no more work to be done.
